"Dear Sir:I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria.Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it.",1
"I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional Progrez supply flights to keep him going since that time. He is in good humor, but wants to come home.In the 14-years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost $ 15,000,000 American Dollars. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost $ 3,000,000 American Dollars. In order to access the his trust fund we need your assistance.Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.",1

Davila of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, granted preliminary approval of this class action Settlement and directed the litigants to provide this notice about the Settlement. You have received this notice because Google’s records indicate that you may be a Settlement Class Member, and you may be eligible to receive a payment from the Settlement. Please visit www.GooglePlusDataLitigation.com for more information. The Final Approval Hearing on the adequacy, reasonableness, and fairness of the Settlement will be held at 9:00 am on November 19, 2020 in San Jose Courthouse, Courtroom 4, 5th Floor located at 280 South 1st Street, San Jose, CA 95113. You are not required to attend the Final Approval Hearing, but you are welcome to do so at your own expense.Summary of LitigationGoogle operated the Google+ social media platform for consumers from June 2011 to April 2019. In 2018, Google announced that the Google+ platform had experienced software bugs between 2015 and 2018, which allowed app developers to access certain Google+ profile field information in an unintended manner. Plaintiffs Matthew Matic, Zak Harris, Charles Olson, and Eileen M. Pinkowski thereafter filed this lawsuit asserting various legal claims on behalf of a putative class of Google+ users who were allegedly harmed by the software bugs (“Class”). Google denies Plaintiffs’ allegations, denies any wrongdoing and any liability whatsoever, and believes that no Class Members, including the Plaintiffs, have sustained any damages or injuries due to the software bugs.Summary of Settlement TermsSettlement Fund: Under the Settlement, Google will pay $7.5 million which will be used to fund: (1) Class Member Settlement payments; (2) attorneys’ fees not to exceed 25% of the Settlement Fund and costs and expenses not to exceed $200,000.00; (3) four service awards to the Class Representatives in an amount not to exceed $1,500 each for their services on behalf of the Settlement Class and for a general release of all claims they may have against Google; (4) administration fees and costs; and, if necessary, (5) cy pres distribution of any residual funds. No portion of the Settlement Fund can be returned to Google.Amount of Payments: Class Members who submit a Valid Claim may receive a pro rata share of the Net Settlement Fund up to a cash payment of $12.00 depending on the number of claimants. Each Class Member can submit only one claim. Any funds remaining in the Net Settlement Fund after distribution(s) to Class Members will be distributed to Cy Pres Recipients that have been selected by a neutral third party and approved by the Court.Method of Payment: The payments above for Class Members who submit a Valid Claim will be made by Electronic Payment (Paypal or Digital Check).Your Options Under the SettlementOption 1 - Submit a Claim Form to Be Eligible for a Cash PaymentIf you submit a Valid Claim by October 8, 2020, you may receive a payment.

"Tomorrow, join Grant Fuller and Daniel Witte online to discover: 'How Epidemiology and the Science of Networks Help Understand Investor Behaviour'  Don't miss your chance to learn how chronic and infectious diseases behave differently from an epidemiological perspective and how those parallels can be used to understand the different kinds of data and information. Book your complimentary ticket today.   How Epidemiology and the Science of Networks Help Understand Investor Behaviour Grant Fuller & Daniel Witte Date: Wednesday, 7th October 2020  Time: 18:00 BST  Location: Online  Speakers: Grant Fuller, Co-Founder of Irithmics, and Daniel Witte, Professor of Diabetes Epidemiology Register What will be discussed during this talk? The bases of modern epidemiology and its role in understanding the spread of infectious and chronic diseases, highlighting some parallels with social sciences and financial markets. The increasingly important role of network analysis approaches for understanding partially observed social systems and on the role of bias. How epidemiology and deep learning have been used to decode the views and expectations of institutional investors. How understanding the spread of infectious and chronic diseases can be used to measure and monitor some evolving dynamics of publicly traded companies, including the dynamics between longer-term, strategic allocations, shorter-term, tactical allocations and selling by systematic strategies and shorting.   About the speakers: Grant Fuller co-founded Irithmics in 2012. The firm's award-winning deep learning technology provides data and services to institutional investors, asset managers, exchanges, corporates, brokers and research analysts. Previously part of Ernst & Young's fund advisory practice, Grant also helped develop Bloomberg's successful hedge fund trading and analytics technology, leading the firm's European and Asian AIM business. Prior to Bloomberg, Grant was part of RiskMetrics, establishing their European fund and asset management analytics and consulting capabilities.   Daniel R. Witte is Professor of Diabetes Epidemiology at the Department of Public Health, Aarhus University and at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. His main research interest is in studying the pathophysiological mechanisms that drive the transition from normal glucose control via pre-diabetes to diabetes and the early stages of its complications at the level of populations. He has a special focus on longitudinal trajectory analyses and analysis of clustering of diabetic complications. His work uses data from several large longitudinal studies, such as the Inter99 and ADDITION trials, the ADDITION-PRO and Whitehall II cohorts, as well as routine medical and population registers in Denmark, which allow the enrichment of cohort datasets with data on the long-term consequences of diabetes and its clinical management.
